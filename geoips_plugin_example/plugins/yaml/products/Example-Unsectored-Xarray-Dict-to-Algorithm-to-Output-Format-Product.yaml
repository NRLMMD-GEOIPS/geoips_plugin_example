docstring: |
  An example product list to demonstrate a variety of combinations of product,
  algorithm, and output formatter families.
spec:
  products:
    - name: Example-Unsectored-Xarray-Dict-to-Algorithm-to-Output-Format-Product
      source_names: [sar-spd]
      docstring: |
        An example product to demonstrate passing unsectored xarrays directly from the
        reader to an algorithm plugin, then passing a dictionary of xarrays returned
        from an algorithm plugin directly to an output formatter.

              extra: "Reader to algorithm to output formatter product"
            docstring: |
              An example algorithm to demonstrate receiving a dictionary of xarray
              datasets as an argument, and returning a dictionary of xarray datasets.
