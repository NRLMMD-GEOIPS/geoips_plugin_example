Description of GeoIPS Plugin Example
************************************

GeoIPS Overview
===============

Please see GeoIPS Documentation Overview for high level information on the
plugin infrastructure.

GeoIPS Plugin Example Repository
================================

This repository provides a working example of GeoIPS plugin functionality.

It includes the following examples of Python plugins:

* filename_formatters

  * test_fname: identical to "geoips_fname" in geoips repository,
    but renamed "test_fname"
* output_formatters

  * imagery_test: identical to "imagery_clean" in geoips repository,
    but renamed "imagery_test"
* algorithms

  * single_channel_test: identical to "single_channel" in geoips repository,
    but renamed "single_channel_test"
* interpolators

  * interp_gauss_test: identical to "interp_gauss" in geoips repository,
    but renamed "interp_gauss_test"
* colormaps

  * Infrared_Test: identical to "Infrared" in geoips repository,
    but renamed "Infrared_Test"

It includes the following examples of YAML product parameter plugins:

* geoips_plugin_example/plugins/yaml/products/abi.yaml

  * Infrared-Test product using variables B14BT
  * Functionality included in geoips_plugin_example abi.yaml product input is
    appended to functionality in all other repos
* geoips_plugin_example/plugins/yaml/product_defaults/visir/Infrared-Test.yaml

  * Infrared-Test product parameters identical to Infrared product parameters
    in geoips repository
  * Infrared-Test product accessible via the "Infrared-Test" product name
    either command line or within a YAML output configuration file.

Creating your own plugin repository
===================================

This geoips_plugin_example can be used as a reference for how different aspects
of the geoips plugin infrastructure can be implemented.  There are separate
"template" plugin package repositories that can be used to actually
create a new plugin package from scratch.  Please see GeoIPS documentation
for additional information on plugin development and template repositories.
