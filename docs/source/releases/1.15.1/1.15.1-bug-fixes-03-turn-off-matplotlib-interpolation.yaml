  - title: "Turn off matplotlib interpolation, and update all test outputs"
    description: |
      Update all test image output that had changes resulting from turning off
      matplotlib image interpolation.

      If we make image interpolation configurable in the future, it still
      makes sense to default to no interpolation for better test output consistency
      between matplotlib versions.
