Bug fixes
=========

Removing non-functional fortran test code
-----------------------------------------

Since the switch to pyproject.toml from setup.py, the fortran build has been
non-functional.  Removing until we determine the optimal path forward for the
fortran build process from pyproject.toml.

Testing Updates
===============

Update test_all.sh call to set/use repopath and pkgname variables.
------------------------------------------------------------------

By default now, set repopath and pkgname variables in test_all.sh, and use those
when calling test_all_pre.sh, check_code.sh, and build_docs.sh.

This is to support build_docs.sh requirement to pass BOTH repopath and pkgname
(rather than implicitly determining pkgname from repopath).

::

  modified: tests/test_all.sh

Documentation Updates
=====================

Updates supporting geoips build_docs and ghpages deploy scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Add required RST files for building documentation from geoips build_docs script.
* Correct RST formatting in docstrings to allow sphinx build
* Support the geoips deploy_pages script to deploy the sphinx html docs to GitHub
  pages for each plugin repository.
* Update test_all.sh to include build_docs.sh call.
