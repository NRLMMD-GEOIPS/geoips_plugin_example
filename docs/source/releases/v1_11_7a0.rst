* Adjust code for newly named Geostationary sectors

Refactoring Updates
===================

Adjust code for newly named Geostationary sectors
-------------------------------------------------

*From issue GEOIPS#304: 2023-08-27, Rename Geostationary Sectors*

GeoIPS has a branch which renamed geostationary sectors. To adhere to these newly named
sectors, we need to update scripts in this package, and well as the outputs, to use
these newly named sectors.
